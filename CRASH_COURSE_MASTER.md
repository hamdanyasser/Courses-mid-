- **If you have only 8 hours:** Skip recurrences/generating functions entirely, reduce practice problems by 40%, take one mini-midterm only.
- **If you have 16 hours:** Add full generating functions section, 50 additional practice problems, create your own practice exam.
- **If stuck on a topic:** Move on after 20 min, mark for review, return at end if time permits.

# PART I: COMBINATORIAL ANALYSIS

## ESSENTIALS ONLY - TL;DR (Combinatorics)

### Core Formulas (Memorize These)

1. **Product Rule:** $|A_1 \times A_2 \times \cdots \times A_n| = |A_1| \cdot |A_2| \cdots |A_n|$

2. **Sum Rule:** $|A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots \cup A_n| = \sum|A_i|$ (if disjoint)

3. **Permutations (no repeat):** $P(n,r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$

4. **Combinations (no repeat):** $C(n,r) = \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$

5. **Permutations with repetition:** $n^r$

6. **Combinations with repetition (stars & bars):** $\binom{n+r-1}{r} = \binom{n+r-1}{n-1}$

7. **Circular permutations:** $(n-1)!$ for $n$ distinct objects

8. **Permutations of multiset:** $\frac{n!}{n_1! n_2! \cdots n_k!}$ where $n = \sum n_i$

9. **Inclusion-Exclusion (2 sets):** $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$

10. **Inclusion-Exclusion (general):** $|A_1 \cup \cdots \cup A_n| = \sum|A_i| - \sum|A_i \cap A_j| + \sum|A_i \cap A_j \cap A_k| - \cdots$

11. **Derangements:** $D_n = n! \sum_{i=0}^{n} \frac{(-1)^i}{i!} \approx \frac{n!}{e}$

12. **Pigeonhole (simple):** If $n+1$ objects in $n$ boxes, some box has $\geq 2$ objects

13. **Binomial theorem:** $(x+y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} x^k y^{n-k}$

14. **Multinomial:** $\frac{n!}{n_1! n_2! \cdots n_k!}$ ways to partition $n$ into groups of sizes $n_1, \ldots, n_k$

### 10 Exam Templates (Pattern → Solution Skeleton)

| # | Pattern | One-Line Solution |
|---|---------|-------------------|
| 1 | "How many ways to arrange/order..." | Check if order matters → permutation |
| 2 | "How many ways to choose/select..." | Order doesn't matter → combination |
| 3 | "...with repetition allowed" | Use $n^r$ (ordered) or stars-bars (unordered) |
| 4 | "Distribute $r$ identical objects into $n$ bins" | Stars and bars: $\binom{n+r-1}{r}$ |
| 5 | "At least one..." | Complement: Total - None |
| 6 | "Exactly one..." | Often use inclusion-exclusion or careful counting |
| 7 | "People around a table" | Circular permutation: $(n-1)!$ |
| 8 | "Letters in MISSISSIPPI" | Multiset permutation: $\frac{n!}{\prod n_i!}$ |
| 9 | "No fixed points / derangement" | Use $D_n$ formula or inclusion-exclusion |
| 10 | "Among $n$ items, how many have property $A$ OR $B$?" | Inclusion-exclusion |

### 5 Mnemonics & Pitfalls

**Mnemonics:**
1. **"Order matters? P. Order doesn't? C."** - Quick decision tree
2. **"Stars and bars = balls in urns"** - Visual: $***|**|*$ means 3,2,1 distribution
3. **"Circular = Fix one, arrange rest"** - $(n-1)!$ comes from fixing one position
4. **"Derangement ≈ 37%"** - $D_n/n! \to 1/e \approx 0.368$
5. **"PIE = sum singles - pairs + triples..."** - Inclusion-exclusion alternates signs

**Pitfalls:**
1. **Don't confuse $P(n,r)$ with $C(n,r)$** - Ask: does order matter?
2. **$\binom{n}{r} = \binom{n}{n-r}$** - Symmetry; use smaller value to compute
3. **Stars and bars**: Formula is $\binom{n+r-1}{r}$ NOT $\binom{n+r}{r}$
4. **Circular permutations**: If items identical/symmetric, divide further
5. **Over-counting**: When using multiplication, check independence of choices
